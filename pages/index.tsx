        <p>ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my website!</p>

          I'm a full-stack web developer, currently working at FATMAP as well as
          running my side-hussle Summit Bag.

          I'll be honest - my main motivation for putting this site live is to
          test the NextJS / TypeScript / Tailwind CSS stack, so you won't find a
          whole load of interesting stuff here right now.
