        I'm British - born and raised on the Isle of Wight - but have been
        living in the Chamonix valley in the French alps since December 2015 - a
        classic case of a "ski-season" which never ended. I currently live in
        Les Houches, just up the road from Chamonix. There is a ski lift 100 m
        from my front door and I make the most of my season pass.

        Outside of coding, my main passion is the outdoors - in particular I
        love trail running, hiking, road biking and ski touring - whether that's
        in new places or in my back yard.

        In February 2022 my and my girlfriend Emily got engaged and we're
        currently planning the wedding as well as negotiating visa applications
        so she can come and join me in France full-time.
